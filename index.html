            <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li><br>
            <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen,paper,or in other media.</li><br>
            <li><span class="para1"><b>Css is not neccesary </b></span><span class="para2"><b>CSS saves a lot of work.</b></span><span> It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</span></li><br>
            <li class="para3"><i>External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</i></li>
        </ol>
        <h2 class="heading"><i>CSS can be be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</i></h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements1</li>
            <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
            <li>External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
            <li>The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However, <span class="para2"><b>in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</b></span> because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements. ID, on the other hand, applies style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.</p>
        <p>In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.</p>
        <p>There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.</p>
